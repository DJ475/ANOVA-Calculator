# ANOVA Calculator
Description: Python script that automates Sum of Squares Within (SSW) calculations for ANOVA analysis.

## Purpose
During my PSY200 course, Data and Statistics, I spent hours on handwritten One-Way ANOVA calculations, computing means, squared differences, and sums of squares across multiple data groups. Each problem usually took more than 1 hour, and a single error would render the entire solution incorrect.

I tried using AI tools to verify my work, but they weren't precise enough for my needs. They'd occasionally miscalculate values or handle rounding inconsistently, especially with larger datasets. Rather than settling for tools that didn't quite fit, I decided to build my own.

This Python script automated the entire process, cutting my calculation time from an hour to seconds while ensuring accuracy. It let me verify my handwritten work with confidence and taught me that I can automate many tasks in my life, setting me on a journey to solve problems and challenges using my programming knowledge.

## What It Does
- Calculates group means for each category
- Computes Sum of Squares Within (SSW) for each group
- Calculates grand mean across all groups
- Computes total SSW across all groups combined
